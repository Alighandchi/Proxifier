Proxifier elevates the foundational capabilities of the Windows Packet Filter's socksify demo, introducing robust enhancements. Not only does it seamlessly integrate support for UDP, but it also empowers users with the flexibility of managing multiple proxy instances. Streamlining its configuration process, Proxifier now dynamically sources its settings from an app-config.json file, ensuring a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.
